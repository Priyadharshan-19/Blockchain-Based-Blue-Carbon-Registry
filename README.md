# 🌱 IoT + Blockchain Environmental Monitoring System

### A Secure, Transparent Data Logging System Using ESP32, Sensors & Ganache

This project showcases how **IoT and Blockchain** can work together to create a transparent, tamper-proof environmental data logging system.
Using an **ESP32**, multiple sensors, and a **private Ethereum blockchain (Ganache)**, the system captures real-time environmental readings and stores each one as an immutable on-chain transaction.

---

## 📘 Overview

This system integrates:

* **ESP32** for real-time IoT sensing
* **Environmental sensors** (Temperature, Humidity, Soil Moisture, CO₂)
* **Ganache blockchain** for decentralized, immutable data logging
* A **Read-Only Verifier Dashboard** for validating on-chain data

Every recorded value becomes part of the blockchain, ensuring **transparency, traceability, and trust** — ideal for environmental monitoring and carbon credit applications.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔹 Real-Time IoT Sensing

The ESP32 captures:

* 🌡️ Temperature
* 💧 Humidity
* 🌱 Soil Moisture
* 🌫️ CO₂ Levels

### 🔹 Blockchain-Based Storage

* Each sensor reading becomes a **transaction**.
* Data is stored on **Ganache**, ensuring tamper-proof logs.
* Built for **data integrity, auditing, and transparency**.

### 🔹 Read-Only Verifier Dashboard

A dedicated dashboard provides:

* Viewing of all blockchain transactions
* Batch verification of sensor entries
* Proof and hash validation
* **JSON / CSV export** for audits

### 🔹 Trust & Transparency

Perfect for:

* Carbon credit monitoring
* Environmental verification systems
* Smart agriculture
* Research and climate tracking
